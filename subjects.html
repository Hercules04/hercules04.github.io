<h3 id=sub1>Choice Subjects</h3>

<p>Last year, we were given a choice of subjects for Transition Year. I chose Culinary Arts, AutoCAD, Philosophy and Web Design. </p>

<img src="/images/culinary.jpeg" alt="Burger and Chips" id=foodPic style="height:250px;width:300px">

<p>Culinary Arts is a triple period class on Monday afternoons. We have cooked a great number of different dishes this year both sweet and savoury. My favourite dish that we cooked was Homemade Beef Burgers and Chips. We also amde Lasagne, Chocolate Cake, Stir Fry, Victoria Sponge and more. This class has taught me a vital life skill and I am a now a more confident chef.</p>

<p>My second choice subject was AutoCAD. CAD stands for Computer Aided Design. This a double class where I used a design software called SolidWorks to design anything from rockets to portable speakers.</p>

<p>I also chose Philosophy. In this class I learnt about topics like ethics, personality and morals. It also gave me a chance to learn about child physchology. It is a really enjoyable class where you talk about really thought-provoking subjects and concepts.</p>

<p>My last choice subject was web design. This was my favourite class of the year. Here I learnt the basics of coding and programming. It was in this class that I learnt some of the required skills to create this website. I really enjoyed this class and I found it incredibly useful. Without it I couldn't have made this website. I also think the knowledge I have gathered in this class might be useful in a future career.</p>

<h3 id=sub2>Core Subjects</h3>

<p>This year we had four core subjects, English, Irish, Maths and French. In English, we have studied drama, poetry, fiction and film. In Irish we read Hurlamaboc, the text we will be studying for the Leaving Cert. On 2 May, I will be sitting the DELF, Diplôme d'Etudes en Langue Française. It is a French exam provided by the French government. We have been studying in preparation for it in French class.</p>

<p>These classes are an introduction to the Leaving Cert and a preview of the content of the classes I will study. These classes also mean we have already studied some of the subject matter for next year. I feel that they have given me an idea of what these subjects will be like for the Leaving Cert.</p>

<h3 id=sub3>Extended Core</h3>

<p>I had the opportunity to study nine different Leaving Cert subjects for rotations of four weeks. The classes were Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Business Studies, Economics, Accounting, History, Religion and Geography. My favourite of these classes was Religion. In Relgion, I studied different religions of the world and looked at customs of different people. I really enjoyed this class and I think it really suited me.</p>

<p>Another class I particularly enjoyed was physics. In physics we studied cosmology. Cosmology is the study of the universe. I found it really interesting. I also enjoyed history. I really enjoyed learning about wars, dictators and kings.</p>

<p>I thought that extended core was really useful when it came to deciding which subjects to choose for the Leaving Cert. In the end I chose Religion, Chemistry, Physics and History.</p>

<h3 id=sub4>Practical Skills</h3>

<p>Another aspect of Transition Year is Practical Skills. Those classes are Drivers' Education, Presentation Skills, Critical Thinking, IT, Basic Cookery, First Aid, Social Development and Career Guidance. These classes taught me important skills that otherwise I would not have had a chance to learn.</p>

<p>I found these classes very useful. In Drivers' Education I learnt about driving theory and practised a drivers' theory test. Then in Presentation Skills, I learnt how to use PowerPoint effectively and was given great advice on speaking for future presentations.</p>

<p>I thought First Aid was a really good class to have. We learnt relevant information and did practical work. I feel I am now equipped to deal with a medical emergency.</p>
