<h1 id="top">Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to my project. This project is about my experiences in Transition Year. I have chosen to create it in the form of a website as web design is one of the classes I took this year. It was a class that I really enjoyed and I thought that creating a website would be a good reflection of what I had learnt and how much I engaged with the subject.</p>

<p>I have really enjoyed Transition Year. I have never been so busy. There is so much to do whether it's English homework, a project, bagpacking or going to something. There are constantly meetings or forms to get signed. Classes have been mad as well. A typical day might include Maths, English, Irish, Culinary Arts, Biology. and First Aid.</p>

<p>I have had a really busy year so far. Before my first class I had spent three days in the Aran Islands. It was a great trip to start the year and to meet some of the new students in the year. Then in January, I spent two weeks in France with a French exchange student. The week after I returned I had to weeks of work experience with E. Fox Engineers Ltd. In March, the French student I had been staying with came here for two weeks. All the time I had been doing activities to complete An Gaisce, taking part in fundraising events for Uganda and other causes and going to a variety of different and uniques classes.</p>

<p>In this project I will be recapping and reflecting on my experiences and contributions to Transition Year. A lot has happened this year and as a result I have plenty to share. I hope you enjoy reading it and that there are no problems with the website!</p>
