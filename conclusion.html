<title>My TY Experience</title>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I truly loved every moment of Transition Year. There was not a single dull moment. I was constantly busy, whether there was an exam to study for, a project deadline coming up, a meeting on or taking part in or planning an event. There was so much to do this year. I have never been so busy or so stressed. I have no idea why anyone would call it a doss year!</p>

<p>There were aspects of Transition Year that I really liked. I loved the Outward Bound activities. I always looked Friday afternoons. I loved orienteering and was dissappointed to only do it twice. I loved hillwalking and rock climbing as well. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to do kayaking, but Outward Bound was one my favourite aspects of Transition Year. Extended Core was another excellent idea. I enjoyed almost every class. It really helped me decide what subjects I chose for the Leaving Cert. I would definitely have made a different decision without extended core. I enjoyed every subject for extended core, especially science subjects and as a result I have chosen two science subjects. I also found practical skills very beneficial, in particular First Aid, Basic Cookery and Presentation Skills. Cookery is a vital skill for later life and we gained first hand practise as well as some great recipes. First Aid has made me feel more comfortable with the idea of giving somebody medical help. My only problem with First Aid was not receiving a form of recognition or  proof like a certificate. Presentaion Skills is also a great idea for a class and I would strongly recommend keeping it on the Transition Year timetable.</p>

<p>If I were asked to make changes there are not many that spring to mind. I would like to see photography added to the list of practical skills but that is a minor complaint. Something I found is that while there was a big focus on career choice and development, I never learnt how to write a CV properly! Again that is not a big complaint.</p>

<p>It really has been a great year. The biggest highlight of the year was easily the French exchange. I really enjoyed it. I met great people in France and drastically improved my French. I also spent time with friends and made friends witht the other Irish students on the exchange. As well as being a great educational experience it was a great social experience. Another big highlight of the year was work experience. Despite not being able to go to Oxfam, I loved working in E.Fox. I worked with some great people and learnt a lot more than I had ever expected. This time with them has only made my potential career choice more difficult as engineering is well up in the list now. My other highlight is Uganda. I have been involved in all the fundraising opportunities for it and as a result I have earnt a place on the trip. U-Live, the Winter Fair and the Fun Run were all great events in their own right and as the Uganda Project they were truly worth getting involved in. Even if I had not been selected to travel to Uganda I would still hace been glad to have supported such a worty cause.</p>

<p>I would love to have Transition Year again next year, but unfortunately, I cannot! If I were to advise someone on how to make the best of it, I would say what I was told at the beginning of the year. You get out of it, what you put into it. I would tell them to get involved  in everything that is available, Gaisce, Run in the Dark, Cycle Against Suicide, Green Schools, the French exchange, the Spannish exchange, Uganda, Young Scientist. As it happens I am disappointed I never got involved in M.U.N. and you can be sure I will get involved next year. If you get involved in all these things, you could find yourself on the plane to Uganda like myself, or receiving your Gaisce medal, or winning the Transition Year Award. Another example, I took a coding class. I put my all into it and now I have made my own website. Transition Year is your chance to learn something new or do something you've always wanted, because next year you won't have nearly as much time. Transition Year really is a chance to learn about yourself. The way I see it, you have two choices. You can sit back and watch it pass you by, or you can get your name down for everything you can, take part in any event you can, do every project to the best of your ability and see the rewards later. After all, you have three months to relax afterwards!</p>

<p>My time in Transition Year is fast coming to an end. I was told in September that it would fly past and it certainly has. I am happy with my level of participation in Transition Year. I feel I got involved in just about everything I could and I enjoyed everything I did. I am not looking forward to fifth year whatsoever, however, I feel there is not much more I could have taken from thie year. I'm sure I'll be wishing I was back here in a few months time!</p>

<p>I am also coming to the end of this project. I hope you enjoyed reading it and that there were no technical difficulties with it. Unfortunately, the end is <a href="end.html">near!</a>
