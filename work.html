<p>I spent two weeks gaining work experience in E.Fox Engineers Ltd. I was originally supposed to spend one week there and one in the Oxfam charity shop, however, the shop was undergoing renovations.</p>

<p>E.Fox is an engineering supplies company. They deal primarily with bearing as well as tools, automotive parts and much more. E.Fox was founded by my great grandfather, Ernest Fox in 1943. Since 2001, they have been located in Baldonnell Business Park.</p>

<p>Between 27th Febraury and 10th March, I spent work experience here. I gained much insight into tools, bearings and engineering as a whole. My main job was working in the stores, picking and putting together orders and stock management. I also spent time working in Goods Inwards. Here I was tasked with recording deliveries and opening them and putting them on the shelf. I was asked to unpbox a shipment of belts for conveyors and other applications. The box was three metres long, two metres high and a metre wide. It was full to the top with belts of varying width, depth and circumference. I easily took out over three hundred belts! They had to counted as they were removed, untangled from each other and divided into different the sizes. It probably took me two hours to unbox. It then took me a futher hour to figure out where they all went and put them in the right place!</p>

<p>From the 3rd to 5th March this year, E.Fox had a stand at the Carole Nash Motorcycle and Scooter Show. On Friday, 3rd March I helped them to set up the stand for the show. We brought loads of stock items for the show, like laser thermometers, piston rings, puller kits, hammers and more. I also helped out at the show on Saturday. This gave me a chance to have a look at the exhibition. I really enjoyed the show and it was a very successful weekend for the stand.</p>

<p>As well as this, I also did some work on the E.Fox website, putting new items on it and adding promotional prices.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed my time with E.Fox. I thought it was really worthwhile. I learnt all about different engineering equipment. I also got the chance to visit the motorbike show. I gained invaluable insight into the career of engineering. Engineering is very much a career choice I am considering and I have not been disuaded by my experience with E.Fox Engineers.</p>
