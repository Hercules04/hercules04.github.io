<h3>Run in the Dark</h3>

<img src="/images/run.jpeg" alt="Run in the Dark" id=runPic style=height:155px;width:200px;float:left;margin-left:10px>

<p id=dark>On 16th November, 2016, I took part in the Run in the Dark. This is a nighttime run around Dublin. The event is a fundraising activity to find a cure for spinal cord injury. The charity behind the event is the Mark Pollock Trust. This trust was set up by a man called Mark Pollock who was the first blind man to venture to the South Pole. Mark had come in to the school to speak to us earlier in the year.</p>

<p id=dark>The event itself consisted of a 5 kilometre and a 10 kilometre run. I did the 5km race. The race started at 8:00pm and started on the quays beside the River Liffey. I ran along the Liffey before turning and running around Point Village and the 3 Arena. The race then rejoined the quays. I then crossed the river over the Samuel Beckett bridge. I ran past the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre before turning around and finishing on City Quay. I finished in around 30 minutes</p>

<p>Thousands of people took part in the run in Dublin and worlwide. I really enjoyed the night as I ran with friends and other people from school and I knew I was supporting a great cause in paralysis research. I will greatly consider taking part in the Run in the Dark in future years.</p>

<h3>Down Syndrome Ireland</h3>

<p>Back in November, I took part in fundraising for Down Syndrome Ireland. A number of students, including myself went to Marks and Spencers in Blackrock to do bagpacking. Over the course of the weekend approximately 30 students from Transition Year took part in bagpacking and helped raise over €1000 for Down Syndrome Ireland.</p>

<p>Transtion Year continue to take part in fundraising for Down Syndrome Ireland and have taken part in bagpacking again since Christmas.</p>

<h3>International Charity Bazaar</h3>

<p>The International Charity Bazaar is a voluntary fundraising organisation that raises funds for registered Irish charities. They have two annual fundraising events, the Diplomatic Ball and the International Charity Bazaar.</p>

<p>The Bazaar is held in the RDS with the help of over 50 embassies. Every year a number of Transition Year students from the school help to organise the event. This year I was one of those students. I helped to layout the hall, source tables and chairs for the stalls of the many different countries and generally assist the setup of the event. There were people from all over the world at the bazaar. While there, you could sample global cuisine.</p>


<h3>Grow</h3>

<p>Grow is a global charity that was founded in Australia in the year 1957. It was setup by previous mental health sufferers in an effort to prevent other mental health problems. Grow now has over 130 groups in Ireland and is supporting people whom have suffered or are suffering from mental health issues.</p>

<p>In April, a pair of representatives from Grow Ireland, a mental health charity came into the school to talk to Transtion Year students and give advice about mental health.</p>

<h3>Upcoming Events</h3>

<h5 style=margin-left:10px>Cycle Against Suicide</h5>

<p>I will be taking part in the annual Cycle Against Suicide on 9th May, 2017. Students from every year in the school get involved in this event. The initiative was created by an Irish entrepeneur called Jim Breen after his appearance on The Secret Millionaire. The idea behind it is to break the cycle of suicide in this country.</p>

<h5 style=margin-left:10px>Walk in my Shoes</h5>

<p>Walk in my Shoes is an event with the goal to spread awareness of homelessness and to raise funds for Focus Ireland, a charity that deals with homelessness in Ireland. The event is unique to Transition Year 2016/2017 as it has never been held before. It is completely organised by students.</p>

<p>After school on Thursday 4th May, we will be told to leave school. We will not be allowed back in until 7:30pm that night. When we return to school, we will be given soup and sandwiches for dinner. We will then sleep on the floor of the sports hall and get up for school the next morning. As well as this, we will wear slippers for the entire event to represent the importance of shoes to the homeless.</p>

<p>The idea is to make people realise the difficulty of being homeless. Accomadation for the homeless is only at night. In the morning they leave and they cannot return until that night. I will be taking part in this event with around 90 students from the year.</p>
