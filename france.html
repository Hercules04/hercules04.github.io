<p>On 5:20pm on Sunday, 22nd January, I left Dublin on Ryanair flight FR1958. We arrived in Nice about two hours later. From there, there was a further two hour bus journey to Hyeres. When I arrived, I waited for my exchange partner. His house was twenty minutes from the school where I had been dropped off. My exchange partner was called Remi and he lived in a village called Pierrefeu-du-Var with his parents and twin brother.</p>

<p>The next day was the first day of school. I got up at 6:00am every morning as school in France started at 8:05am and was thirty minutes on the bus from his house. The school is called Cours Maintenon and Remi is in seconde, the equivalent of fourth year in France, however, they are studying for exams at the end of the year. I attended classes here with Remi. He studies French, English, Italian, Maths, history and geography as one subject, physics, chemistry, biology, civics, and religion. I was also given time in the library to work on the projects we had been given about our time in France. The school in France was completely different to school in Ireland. In this school, the students had all their classes in the same classroom and the teachers would change room every class. Those classes were very long. The average class was fifty five minutes long. Most of the classes were actually double classes. This meant on Thursday morning, I had two hours of French literature and on Monday afternoon, I had two hours of history-geography! The school was also very religious. There was a large chapel in the school with services everyday. Every classroom had a cross in it and in the morning before the first class the entire class stood and prayed. Another rule in the school  was that when the teacher came to the classroom, you stand up until you are told to sit down. At twelve o'clock each day, the entire school had their lunch break. Every student, including myself and the other Irish students, ate in the cafeteria. The students had cards like our own and we were given a ticket each day. In the cafeteria, you got a starter, main, and dessert for your ticket. The starter might be salami or a small salad and the desert might be mousse or a crepe. Every day for the main course you could have chips. Most of the French students were sick of them at this stage but it was a novelty to me. You could also get pizza, chicken nuggets, a burger or similar. As well as this there was often curry or meat. Lunch lasted an hour, sometimes more depending on when your next class started. My exchange partner also played badminton. He played badminton every Tuesday after school which meant I got to play badminton while I was away.</p>

<p>I really miss the French food! Dinner was all eaten from the bowl. I was given a bowl of soup each night. The most amazing soup I ever had in my life. Then I was given a piece of bread to eat the remnents of said soup. The bread was delicous. It was soft yet crispy and warm. Then the dinner would be brought to the table and I would reuse the soup bowl. One night, we had cottage pie, another we had carbonara, another we had lasagne. I never had the same thing for dinner twice. One Saturday, for lucnh we had sangliere and chips. Sangliere means wild boar. This was a wild boar that Remi's dad had killed. It was stunning, the best meal I had in France. One morning, before I woke up, somebody had gone to the bakery and returned with croissants and pain au chocolat. They were amazing. They were still warm. It was better than any croissant I have had in Ireland. On the final day, Remi and I made crepes. They were enormous and again delicious. I probably ate about six of them. I have made them here since but they weren't quite as good as France. I also had some unusual food in France. I tried an artichoke. It was truly weird. There was so much to peel off and it was boiling hot. To be quite honest, I found it repulsive. I also tried cheese that I was not particularly fond of. It was blue and moluldy. It was absolutley vile. One day after school, we went to a French chipper. I had a burger and chips. It was the worst chipper I have ever set foot in. The burger was foul and the chips were terrible. As well as all this I tried snails and frogs' legs! The frogs' legs were bizzare. There was very little meat on them and they were almost completely flavourless. The snails on the other hand, were quite nice. You pick them out of the shell with a cocktail stick. The texture is not very pleasant, but I thought they tasted quite nice.</p>

<p>The first weekend, we went for a drive and a walk. We went to a beach about an hour away from the house. It was beautiful and peaceful. The sea was calm and blue. That night we did laser tag with all the Irish students and their partners. It was great fun. Another night we did bowling. It was an hour drive as it was in Toulon. Unfortunately, I wasn't too good at either but I still really enjoyed it and being able to speak to other people from Ireland was nice. I also took Remi's family's boat out to island of the coast called Porquerolles. When we got there, we met the other Irish students and went for a walk. We got to a square where we played football before walking onto a beach. It was the most beautiful beach I had ever seen. It was a serene, bright blue Mediterranean beach. We had lunch which we had brought from and relaxed on the beach. The next day I went hunting with Remi's dad. We drove to a forrest about two hours away from the house. We didn't see anything except for spectacular views from the top of the mountain.</p>

<p>On 5th February we all got the bus to Nice airport and boarded the flight to Dublin at 9:00 pm. We got home by about 11:00pm.</p>

<h2>Dublin</h2>

<p>At 11:00pm, on Sunday, 12th March, I greeted Remi in Dublin airport.</p>

<p>He came to school with me for the next two weeks. He spent a lot of time in Leaving Cert French classes helpig them prepare for exmas.</p>

<p>On St. Patrick's Day, we all went to town with our exchange partners to see the St. Patrick's Day Parade. It was a really enjoyable day and the French students really embraced the spirit off the day. I also did the Bray to Greystones walk with him and introduced him to a proper chipper. He also got a chance to play badminton in school with me.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the French exchange. I thought was a really good experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone studying French. It was in a really lovely place and with very friendly people. I thought Hyeres was amazing. It was completely different to Dublin. It was a semi rural town, tall buildings and beautiful scenery. The people were also very friendly and welcomming. My exchange partner and his family were very kind and helpful. I really enjoyed everyday I spent with them. The school was also friendly. It was easy to make friends with other students in the school who weren't necessarily taking part in the exchange. I also thought the exchange really improved my level of French, particularly my spoken French as I was constantly surrounded by French culture and native French speakers. I learnt a lot of new French and how they are pronounced properly. I found my French accent had come on immensely in a recent oral exam! I had reservations about the idea of the exchange at first but I really would recommend it and I am really glad I got involved. It was one of the highlights of my year.</p>
