<p>Since the start of the year I have been completing the bronze award for An Gaisce. The award requires you to do a personal skill activity for thirteen weeks, a physical recreation activity for thirteen weeks and a community involvement activity for thirteen weeks. You must do each activity for at least one hour each week. Then you must choose one activity to do for a further thirteen weeks. There is also an adventure journey to be completed, which is a two day one night journey where you walk between 25-30 kilometres or cycle between 100-130 kilometres.</p>

<p>For my personal skill, I started learning the guitar. The guitar is an instrument I had always wanted to play and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn. I started taking lessons on Wednesday evenings which I am still attending after the required thirteen weeks.</p>

<p>My physical recreation activity was badminton. I went to badminton after school on Mondays. I was vice-captain of the Under 16s badminton team. We had matches against High School, Gonzaga, St. Benildus College, Sandford Park and Lyc√©e. Unfortunately, we did not progress to the final.</p>

<p>For community involvement I was a junior churchwarden at my local church.</p>
