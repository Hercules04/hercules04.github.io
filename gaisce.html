<p>An Gaisce, or the President's Award, is an award scheme for people between the ages of 15 and 25. It was introduced in 1985. The President of Ireland was the patron of the award and the first ceremony for the awards was performed by President Patrick Hillery in 1989. Upon completion of the award the candidate is present with a medal the colour of the respective award. The gold award is presented by the President, Michael D. Higgins.</p>

<p>Since the start of the year I have been completing the bronze award for An Gaisce. The award requires you to do a personal skill activity for thirteen weeks, a physical recreation activity for thirteen weeks and a community involvement activity for thirteen weeks. You must do each activity for at least one hour each week. Then you must choose one activity to do for a further thirteen weeks. There is also an adventure journey to be completed, which is a two day one night journey where you walk between 25-30 kilometres or cycle between 100-130 kilometres.</p>

<p>For my personal skill, I started learning the guitar. The guitar is an instrument I had always wanted to play and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn. I started taking lessons on Wednesday evenings which I am still attending after the required thirteen weeks.</p>

<p>My physical recreation activity was badminton. I went to badminton after school on Mondays. I was vice-captain of the Under 16s badminton team. We had matches against High School, Gonzaga, St. Benildus College, Sandford Park and Lyc√©e. Unfortunately, we did not progress to the final.</p>

<p>For community involvement I was a junior churchwarden at my local church. It was a great opportunity to give back to the community and to meet people whom you would not otherwise talk to.</p>

<p>The adventure journey was a camping trip organised by the school. Around thirty students and four teachers went on the camp. On 23rd September, we got a bus to Glendalough after school. From there we went on a walk over the Wicklow mountains. After the four hour hike, we arrived at the spot where we would be spending the night and divided into the groups we were tenting in. We were then given a camping stove to cook our dinner. We had burgers, steaks and sausages! After dinner, we had a campfire before going to bed.</p>

<p>The next morning we cooked rashers and sausages for breakfast! Right before we were meant to leave the heavens opened. Eventually, it stopped raining and we walked to the bus.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed taking part in An Gaisce. Through the community involvement section of the process I feel I have given back to the community and met some great people as well. While playing badminton and camping I got to spend time with friends and made new friends with people I had never really takled to before. An Gasice also gave me a chance to learn the guitar. I really enjoy playing it and it is something I am sure I will continue to do. I think that I have greatly benefitted from this experience. I may also consider the silver and gold awards in the future.</p>
