<title>My TY Experience</title>
<h1>Outward Bound + P.E.</h1>

<p>Every Friday afternoon, Transition Year students take part in either Outward Bound or P.E. for the last three classes of the day. Many of the activities take place off the school grounds. Before Christmas, I took part in Outward Bound activities and since I have been doing P.E.</p>

<h2>Outward Bound</h2>

<h4>Rock Climbing</h4>

<p>There were two types of rock climbing, indoor rock climbing and outdoor rock climbing. Outdoor rock climbing was in Dalkey. The climbing took place in Dalkey Quarry. Here I got to try abseiling and climbing. This was the first time I had ever tried rock clibing and I really enjoyed it. Indoor rock climbing took place at The Wall in Sandyford Industrial Estate. The Wall is an indoor bouldering wall with over 1000 square metres of climbing surface. There are different colour climbs based on their difficulties. While we there, we had a competition. You got more points for doing more difficult climbs. I really enjoyed both indoor and outdoor rock climbing but I prefered indoor rock climbing. We got to spend the entire time climbing in Sandyford whereas we only got to climb and abseil once in Dalkey.</p>

<h4>Orienteering</h4>

<p>One of the first activities was orienteering. Orienteering also took place in Dalkey and required getting the DART from school and walking to Kiliney Hill where a course had been set up. It involved following a map around the course to find flags. Each flag had a stamp on it which you had to stamp onto a sheet of paper. The team that colected all five stamps from the five flags and get back to the start in the quickest time was the winner. I really enjoyed orienteering. I really liked the map reading element and the race element.</p>

<h4>Hillwalking</h4>

<p id=paragraph>I did three hillwalks this year, one at Ticknock, one in Bray and one in Co. Wicklow. The first one was Ticknock. We got the bus from school to Ticknock and started walking. It was raining and incredibly windy. The weather was absolutely miserable and we were all relieved to get back to the bus. The second walk was the Bray walk. We walked by the coast to Bray Head. There was a great view from the top as shown and the weather was much more pleasant. The third walk took place in December. This walk was from the JB Malone Memorial to Crone Wood via Djouce Mountain. It was very slippery as it had rained earlier that day making it very difficult to come down the mountain. This walk very great fun as there were so many people. Half the year took part in this walk, over 80 students.</p>

<h2>P.E.</h2>

<h4>Tennis</h4>

<p>Tennis took place in Leopardstown Tennis Club near the Sandyford Industrial Estate. This meant getting the bus from school. There are six courts in the tennis club which gave us plenty of room to play. We played doubles matches, singles matches and fun mini games as well. I really enjoyed tennis. I liked the sense of competition yet still spending a relaxed and enjoyable afternoon.</p>

<h4>Jumpzone</h4>

<p>Jumpzone is an indoor trampoline park located in Sandyford Industrial Estate. Jumpzone is the perfect place to exercise and enjoy yourself at the same time. The main floor of trampolines is 6,500 square feet in size and they also have a dodegbeall court, 3,000 square feet in size. There are also foam pits and basketball hoops. I really enjoyed the variety in Jumpzone. Not only can you jump, but do tricks, play dodgeball or play basketball.</p>
