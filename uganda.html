<h3>Winter Fair</h3>

<p>The first fundraising event for Uganda this year was the Winter Fair. The Winter Fair was held on 15th December, 2016 and was organised solely by transition year students. There were a host of games and stalls. One of the biggest stalls was the raffle stall, as the main prize was Drake tickets. Another big attraction was the tombola stall. This year there were over 1,000 prizes! Among the games were Spin the Wheel, Basketball, Bottle Flipping, Lucky Dip and FIFA. As well as games, there was plenty of great food. There were crepes, waffles, hot drinks, cakes, popcorn and American sweets. As well as all this, there were Uganda t-shirts on sale, books on sale and art made by the students on display and for sale. The event was a great success and truly marked the start of the Uganda Project 2017. Despite missing most fifth and sixth year students, there was still plenty of interest from the other senior school students, junior school students and parents. We managed to raise roughly €9,000 in total. I was on the organising committee. I mapped out the layout in the hall and helped source tables and chairs for stalls. I was also helping on the Bottle Flipping stall.</p>

<h3>U-Live</h3>

<p>U-Live is the second fund-raising activity for the Uganda Project. It is an annual school concert in aid of Uganda. Tickets are €5 for children and €10 for adults. The concert is comprised of students in the school only. Like the Winter Fair,it is run by Transition Year students.</p>

<p>U-Live was held on Wednesday 8th February. I stayed to help with the soundcheck after school. I noted the order of the acts and the required microphones and chairs for each performer. I then met with the sound engineers to discuss the required equipment for each act. The soundcheck lasted right up until the show was about to start. The concert started at 7:30pm. I spent the entire concert backstage directing performers and making sure the concert ran in order. It ran a bit over the time we had expected but it was still a great show. I had a great time working on U-Live. I was exhausted by the end as it ran on until 10:30pm. </p>

<h3>Fun Run</h3>

<p>On 10th February, 2017, every Transtion Year student took part in a Fun Run for Uganda. Instead of going to Outward Bound or P.E., we all got the DART to Shankhill.We walked from the station to Shanganagh Park. We ran three times around the park. The run was five kilometres in total. I finished in a slightly quicker time than I had in the Run in the Dark! It was a great afternoon. The weather was quite nice and I was running with my friends for a great cause in Uganda.</p>

<h3>Uganda 2017</h3>

<p>I have been lucky enough to be selected to travel to Uganda later this month. I am travelling in a group of eighteen students. We are going to visit Kisiizi Hospital, Rubirizi School and the Good Shepherd's Fold Orphanage. I will get a chance to teach a class for a day in the primary school. We will be shown around the hospital and meet children in the orphanage. We will also spend a few days camping on Bushara Island on Lake Bunyoni. I am really excited about the prospect of travelling to Uganda. </p>
